# US-Accidents-Severity-Prediction
Introduction:
The purpose of this project is to predict the severity of accidents in the US and identify trends in accident rates. To achieve this goal, I built decision tree, naive Bayes, and multilayer perceptron models in Python, and used various visualization tools to analyze the data.

Methodology:
I first collected a dataset of US accidents from 2016 to 2020, which included information such as location, weather conditions, and severity level. Using this data, I built decision tree, naive Bayes, and multilayer perceptron models to predict accident severity based on factors such as weather, road conditions, and location.

In addition to building models, I also used visualization tools such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Tableau to identify patterns in accident rates and explore trends over time. These visualizations helped me gain a deeper understanding of the data and provided insights into potential causes of accidents.

Results:
My models achieved high accuracy in predicting accident severity, with the decision tree model performing the best. I also identified several trends in accident rates, including higher rates of accidents during rush hour and in areas near junctions. These findings can be used to inform policy decisions and help reduce the number of accidents in the US.

Conclusion:
Overall, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting accident severity and the importance of data visualization in identifying patterns and trends. I'm open to collaboration and feedback on how to improve this project and further our understanding of accident rates in the US.
